immediate vs retained mode


Retained Mode is declarative. In retained mode, the graphics library keeps a copy of the scene. When the scene needs to be updated, the graphics library is responsible for changing the scene. Considered easy and simple to use since

Immediate mode is procedural. The application itself is required to maintain and update the scene. Anytime a new frame is produced, all drawing commands are requested and used to draw the scene. Considered more complex than Retained mode, but offers more flexibility and optimization.
